## Yiuf's Home for Lost and Forgotten Species ##

# big goals
get better at coding code
recover all removed races
recover all experimental races
make little changes to all races - the selling point of this fork is "change of pace"
develop a philosophy of cross training to define species more than apts
probably means flatter apts
make game slightly easier
especially vault$ and zot$ and slime$

# code with care to make it easy for players to try it out
try to invalidate as few learndb entries as possible.
for instance, don't change shield base value or encumbrance value
instead you can make SH scale better with skill, or stats

# misc small desires
AC, EV, and SH need to choose one specific "identity" each from the following:
shrug off swarms of lesser foes
survive against big scary foes
being particularly good against ranged attacks
